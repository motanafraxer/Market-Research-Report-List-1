<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The In screen Fingerprint Scanning Module Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Optical</li><li>Ultrasonic</li></ul></p>
<p><p>In-screen fingerprint scanning modules are categorized into two primary types: optical and ultrasonic. Optical scanners use light to capture fingerprint images by illuminating the finger and reading the reflected light, making them cost-effective but less secure against spoofing. Ultrasonic scanners, on the other hand, utilize high-frequency sound waves to generate a detailed 3D map of the fingerprint, offering enhanced security and performance, especially under various conditions. Both technologies cater to the growing demand for seamless biometric authentication in devices.</p></p>
