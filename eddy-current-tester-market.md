<p><strong>Market Segmentation</strong></p>
<p><strong>The Eddy Current Tester Market Analysis by types is segmented into:</strong></p>
<p><ul><li>Contact Tester</li><li>Non-contact Tester</li></ul></p>
<p><p>The Eddy Current Tester market is segmented into two main types: contact testers and non-contact testers. Contact testers require physical contact with the test surface, providing precise measurements for flaw detection and material characterization. They are often used in applications that demand high accuracy. Non-contact testers, on the other hand, operate without touching the surface, offering faster assessments and reducing the risk of damage. This type is beneficial for delicate materials and complex geometries, enhancing inspection efficiency across various industries.</p></p>
